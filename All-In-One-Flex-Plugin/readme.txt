This plugin extends the ACF Flexible Content inside the Beaver Builder Plugin.
== Description ==
This plugin extends the ACF Flexible Content inside the Beaver Builder Plugin in such a way, that you can easily add your Flexible Content into a blog post.
This is yet to be customized and made more flexible, but as of now, there are naming conventions to use the plugin.
This plugin is now on v0.5, which means it is the base of what it should be capable to do. More version updates will be released soon with the help of our Contributors Pageking, WebDepot and Teun Rompa.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this plugin usable already? =
As there are specific naming conventions, we do not expect people will use it already. Later on, we will make it easier by making it more flexible, so you don't need to follow the specific naming conventions.
= What about the authors? =
The authors of this plugin are Pageking, Webdepot and Teunrompa. Pageking is a Digital Creative Agency based in the Netherlands and are using the stable base of Beaver Builder to setup websites for clients fast and easy.
WebDepot and Teunrompa are emmployees at Pageking and are working on this plugin. Our goal is to get it distributed at least on our websites by over-the-air updates. We would love to hear other success stories later on from other people using our plugin.
As of this moment, the plugin will be less easy to understand for people outside of Pageking, but we will make it more accessible without the naming conventions inside of the team.
== Changelog ==
= 0.1 =
* Base of the plugin is made and you are able to use it inside Beaver Builder.
* Text, Image, Quote and Carrousel features are added.
* Naming conventions are a must.
== Upgrade Notice ==
= Nothing to see here yet =
